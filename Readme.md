AvaloniaUI showcase written in PascalABC.NET
============================================

This is a sample of [AvaloniaUI][avaloniaui] usage written in
[PascalABC.NET][pascalabc-net].

See [this post][post] (in Russian) for detailed discussion.

**NOTE:** Since the initial post, the project has been migrated to [PascalABC.NET SDK][sdk], so the build instructions are different.

To build the project, run the following shell command:

```console
$ dotnet build
```
